# hacked

Hacked is a responsive, minimalistic Jekyll theme for a personal website that lists information in a format resembling a JSON file. The description field uses [typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) to cycle through multiple lines, if these are provided in the configuration file. Otherwise, it defaults to a single line.

The style is rebooted through [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and based on the [open color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) library. The typeface [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) is served together with the website. The favicons are generated by [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Rename it to `[username].github.io`.
3.  Start editing!

## Usage

Besides replacing favicons, all customization happens in the `json` section of `_config.yml`. The color scheme is determined by three lines in `_sass/base.scss`:

```scss
body {
  ...
  background-color: var(--oc-gray-9);
  color: var(--oc-green-4);
}
```

```scss
a {
  ...
  &:hover,
  &:active {
    color: var(--oc-green-5);
  }
}
```
