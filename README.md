# hacked

Hacked is a responsive, one-page Jekyll theme for a personal website that lists information in a format resembling a JSON file. The description field uses [typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) to cycle through multiple lines, if these are provided in the configuration file. Otherwise, it defaults to a single line.

The style is rebooted through [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and based on the [open color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) library. The favicons are generated by [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). Besides replacing favicons, all customization happens in the `json:` section of `_config.yml`. Replace this information as needed.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Rename it to `[username].github.io`.
3.  Start editing!
